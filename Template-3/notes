[1] design for min 992px 
[2] design fr min-width 767px
[3] for mobile
[4] the trnastion tag better to be last line in selector
[5] to hide image use a parent div 
[6] fill animation with before left -100% => left 0 , z-index -1 
[7] in header to keep the height fixed giv logo any height 
[8] column effect in flex could done by giving first child 100% width , and flex-wrap: wrap
[9] cant put Transform & Animation in the same element
[10] when we use delay on the parent(unHoverd element) it works before transition and after 
        but when we use it on :hover it works only when transition start
[11] #animation# if we set property to change at 100% => the change will spreate from 0% - 100% 
        unless we set value to the same property on e.g 30% then the chang will be from 30% - 100%
[12] # transition & :hover # cant use on hover " left right top bottom " unless put initial value on the unHoverd state to the same direction
{do close section which open on hover}
{do a 2-3-4 element with responesev grid(.container) class }

[13] # ::before # must have absolute position to fill the parent 
[14] # img on flex # to keep the espact ratio fixed use margin:auto ;
[14] # img on flex THE Resone # disolay:flex => aling-items:stretech => bad image
[15] # Background Animation # to keep the animation smooth and avoid the cut (after the 100% the Background will inmediatly get back to the old one -no trnasition effect- )
        to solve this problem use the same Background at ( 0% , 100% ) then set the onther Background at ( 50% )
